Smart Money Woman by *Arese Ugwu*



**Introduction**



Although, the book title appeared to be quite descriptive, I was not sure of what to expect as this was my first time of reading a book on financial literacy from the lenses of a citizen of the country with the largest population of black people on the surface of the earth - Nigeria -, however, deep down I could already feel some sense of a connection to a journey I have always aspired to travel but never had enough strong will to embark on.



Chapter 1 - Broke

And the story begins...

Broke	means,	if	you	lost	your	primary
source	of	income	today,	you	wouldn't	be
able	to	maintain	the	lifestyle	you	have
become	accustomed	to	because	you	have	no
assets	to	rely	on.	

broke	people	think	it	is	about	how
much	you	earn	but	rich	people	know	it's
about	how	much	of	your	income	you	are
able	to	keep	and	convert	into	assets	that	can
provide	you	with	an	income	in	the	future

Passive	income	in	simple	terms	is	money
that	you	make	while	you	are	sleeping.	It	is
the	income	you	get	regularly	from
investments	you've	already	made

What	Is	Financial	Freedom?
When	passive	income	exceeds	your
expenses.

Your	net	worth	is
your	assets	minus	your	liabilities



The main character, Zuri, was introduced in a manner that depicts the situation of a typical middle class person in Nigeria.



One living with a fat salary but not sure where the money goes some days before the next salary is paid and wish that the calendar could by some magic shift backwards.



One with not so extravagant nor a prudent lifestyle, however, debt just somehow seem to rear its neck from every angle and worse when a single event completely destabilizes one's life for months.



Her extroverted childhood friend, Tami, seems to be not too different from her and even proposes what an average middle class would think which is to transfer the responsibility of money to someone else.



In their case as they are from Africa, one option was having a rich husband or boy friend ( making Zuri reconsider her independent lifestyle ).



But to others, it could be the government.



And some their employer.



One of the beauties about the chapter is the rich collection of nuggets for financial literacy it packs towards the end. A nugget is captured below: 


Developing a wealthy mind-set requires the understanding of the concept that the way you spend, invest, and manage ten naira is the way you'll spend, invest, and manage ten million





I am very well familiar with but this time around it hit differently, perhaps because of the preceding story of Zuri.



I am a very big fan of Robert Kiyosaki largely because of the simplicity with which he teaches various concept in finance but reading this book that also follows similar ideology in an African context makes the concepts more relatable.



Really looking forward to the next chapter...



Till next time, remain grateful and financially conscious.
