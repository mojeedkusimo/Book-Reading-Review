Smart Money Woman by *Arese Ugwu*



**Introduction**



Although, the book title appeared to be quite descriptive, I was not sure of what to expect as this was my first time of reading a book on financial literacy from the lenses of a citizen of the country with the largest population of black people on the surface of the earth - Nigeria -, however, deep down I could already feel some sense of a connection to a journey I have always aspired to travel but never had enough strong will to embark on.



Chapter 1 - Broke

And the story begins...

The main character, Zuri, was introduced in a manner that depicts the situation of a typical middle-class person in Nigeria.

One living on a high salary but unsure where the money goes, some days before the next salary is paid, and wishes that the calendar could somehow shift backwards.

One with not so extravagant nor a prudent lifestyle, however, debt just somehow seems to rear its head from every angle and worse when a single event completely destabilises one’s life for months.

Her extroverted childhood friend, Tami, seems not to be too different from her and even proposes what an average middle-class person would think, which is to transfer the responsibility of money to someone else.

In their case, as they are from Africa, one option was having a rich husband or boyfriend ( making Zuri reconsider her independent lifestyle ).

But to others, it would be relying on the government.

And some, depending upon their employer for financial security.

One of the beauties of the chapter is the rich collection of nuggets for financial literacy it packs towards the end. A nugget is captured below:

Developing a wealthy mindset requires the understanding of the concept that the way you spend, invest, and manage ten naira is the way you’ll spend, invest, and manage ten million

I am very familiar with but this time around, it hit differently, perhaps because of the preceding story of Zuri.

I am a very big fan of Robert Kiyosaki largely because of the simplicity with which he teaches various concepts in finance, but reading this book that also follows a similar ideology in an African context makes the concepts more relatable.

According to Arese,

Broke means, if you lost your primary source of income today, you wouldn’t be able to maintain the lifestyle you have become accustomed to because you have no assets to rely on.

Broke people think it is about how much you earn, but rich people know it’s about how much of your income you can keep and convert into assets that can provide you with an income in the future.

Passive income, in simple terms, is money that you make while you are sleeping. It is the income you get regularly from investments you’ve already made, which can lead to Financial freedom when the passive income exceeds your expenses.

I am really looking forward to the next chapter…

Till next time, remain grateful and financially conscious. 


Chapter 2 - Money fears

As the pressure from the accumulated debt keeps rising, Zuri finds it extremely difficult to sleep without using sleeping pills.

Weird nightmares show up, all around her money problems as well as her health condition, which she realised would also cost a lot to treat.

The impact of her state of mind is unsurprisingly impacting her performance at work.

One thing I think the Author, Arese Ugwu, tries to chip in or suggest is the importance of mentorship. This is because Zuri's supervisor is portrayed as someone who is especially interested in her career growth despite being oblivous of the trauma Zuri is facing.

Sometimes, we think we are strong enough to achieve anything we set out to do, alone, while ignoring an African proverb:

What an old man sees sitting down, a young man cannot see standing up

And a popular quote by Bob Proctor:

A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you.

Although Zuri does not seem interested at this point, I strongly believe the effort to rekindle the drive in Zuri would be revisited sometime later in the book

Zuri had various not-so-good encounters with her family and landlord in an attempt to find a lasting solution to the quagmire she finds herself in, but at the end of the day, she kept wondering how she had been working for eight years and had no assets to show for her hard work.

Another nugget of the book I loved in this chapter is captured below:

What you deny or ignore, you delay; what you accept and face, you conquer. At the end of the day, we are all afraid of something, but the difference between successful people and ordinary people is that they acknowledge their fears but don't let fear overcome them or stop them from achieving their goals.

Till next time, remain grateful and financially fearless.
